# Wonda CLI

Wonda CLI is a content creation toolkit for terminal-based agents. Use it to generate images, videos, music, and audio; edit and compose media; publish to social platforms; and research/automate across LinkedIn, Reddit, and X/Twitter.

## Install

If `wonda` is not found on PATH, install it first:

```bash
# npm
npm i -g @degausai/wonda

# Homebrew
brew tap degausai/tap && brew install wonda
```

## Setup

- **Auth**: `wonda auth login` (opens browser, recommended) or set `WONDA_API_KEY` env var
- **Verify**: `wonda auth check`

### Organizations & spend context

Wondercat orgs are shared wallets with their own seats and billing.
Members can spend from the org wallet (instead of their personal credits)
by switching context:

- `wonda organizations list` (aliases: `wonda orgs list`, `wonda org list`) — see every org you belong to with your role and seat plan in each.
- `wonda use --org <slug>` — sticky org context for this machine. Sets
  `X-Wonda-Org` on every request; holds, charges, and `wonda balance`
  route through the org wallet.
- `wonda use --personal` — back to personal.

`wonda topup` always tops up your **personal** wallet, regardless of
context. Topping up the org wallet (and configuring auto top-up) is
admin-only and happens on the web at `/organizations/<slug>`. If a
member runs out of org credits, the error tells them to ask an admin or
switch back to personal — they cannot top up the org wallet from CLI.

Roles inside an org are separate from the seat plan:

- **Owner**: the original creator. Cannot be demoted or kicked. Can transfer ownership to another member from the org page (rare).
- **Admin**: can invite (single or bulk via paste), kick, change roles, change seats, top up, configure auto top-up, change monthly limits.
- **User**: can only spend within the org wallet (subject to a per-member monthly limit if the admin set one).

A paid org seat (`WONDA` / `WONDA_PREMIUM`) grants the same paid feature access (skills, etc.) as a personal paid plan, but only while in org context. `wonda use --personal` falls back to the user's personal account plan.

### Access tiers

Not all commands are available to every account type:

| Tier                                        | Access                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anonymous** (temporary account, no login) | Media upload/download, editing (`video/edit`, `image/edit`, `audio/edit`), transcription, social publishing, scraping, analytics |
| **Free** (logged in, Basic/Free plan)       | Everything above + **generation** (`image/generate`, `video/generate`, etc.), styles, recipes, brand                             |
| **Paid** (Plus, Pro, or Absolute plan)      | Everything above + **video analysis** (requires credits), **skill commands** (`wonda skill install/list/get`)                    |
| **Flagged** (per-account PostHog flags)     | `wonda transitions` (transitionsEnabled), `wonda clipping` (clippingEnabled). Flip the flag in PostHog for the account.          |

If a command returns a `403` error, check your plan at https://app.wondercat.ai/settings/billing.

### Social signups (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)

Drive them with the `wonda device` primitives + a throwaway mailbox from `wonda email`. The screenshot → decide → tap/type/swipe loop is how these flows work — there's no shortcut command, and that's fine: social apps change their UI constantly and any canned flow would drift faster than you could maintain it.

Standard loop:

1. `wonda email account create --random` → save `{email, password}`. Persist the resulting platform login with `wonda credentials create --website instagram.com --username <handle> --email <email> --password-stdin <<< "<pw>"` (passwords are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest; retrieve later with `wonda credentials get <id>`).
2. `wonda device create` → pick a `ready` device (poll `wonda device get <id> --fields status`).
3. `wonda device launch <device-id> com.instagram.android` (or `com.zhiliaoapp.musically` for TikTok). Fall back to `wonda device open-url` if you'd rather start in the web flow.
4. Loop: `wonda device screenshot <device-id> > s.json` → decode the base64 PNG → read → pick an action → `tap | type | swipe | key` → screenshot again. Use `--text "SomeButtonLabel"` on `tap` before guessing coordinates; fall back to `--x --y` read off the screenshot for elements without matching text (number pickers, date spinners, etc.).
5. When the app sends a verification email, `wonda email inbox wait <email> --timeout 120` — returns `{codes: ["483921"], links: [...]}` with the 6-digit code already extracted. `wonda device type <device-id> --text "<code>"` to feed it back. **Race-safety**: capture a timestamp _before_ triggering the signup (`SINCE=$(date -u +%FT%TZ)`) and pass `--since "$SINCE"` — otherwise a fast mail server can land the email before your wait call and the old snapshot filters it out.
6. For number/date spinners: tap on the highlighted cell, Android pops up a numeric or alphabetic keyboard, `wonda device type --text "<value>"` replaces the selected text. `wonda device key --code 4` dismisses the keyboard when done.

**Consent-like taps** — anything that accepts Terms/Privacy/Cookies, grants permissions, or publishes something. Before starting an automation that may hit these, ask the user once in chat whether to auto-accept them. If they say yes, tap through without pausing; if they say no, stop at each one and confirm. This does not apply to CAPTCHAs or "prove you're human" puzzles — always hand those off via `wonda device stream` (see next section).

**Rate-limit signals** — if the app shows you a visual puzzle ("we want to make sure you're a real person"), stop and hand off to the user with `wonda device stream <id>` (see next section). Don't click through puzzles yourself.

### Voice cloning

Clone a voice from a 10s+ audio clip and use it in TTS. Hard limit: 20 cloned voices per account. Cost: $1.50 per clone.

```bash
# Clone from a local file (auto-uploads to media library first)
wonda voice create "Andu" --file ./sample.mp3 --description "My voice"

# Clone from existing wonda media
wonda voice create "Brand" --media-id <uuid>

# Optional source-audio preprocessing
wonda voice create "Clean" --file ./raw.wav --noise-reduction --normalize-volume

# List cloned voices (each row reports isExpired and expiresInDays)
wonda voice list

# One voice
wonda voice get <voice-id>

# Rename / re-describe (local only, no provider call)
wonda voice update <voice-id> --name "New Name" --description "..."

# Delete
wonda voice delete <voice-id>
```

**Use a cloned voice in TTS** by passing the `providerVoiceId` from `voice get` as `voiceId` to `/audio/speech`:

```bash
wonda audio speech "Hello world" \
  --model minimax-speech-2-8-hd \
  --params '{"voiceId":"<providerVoiceId>"}'
```

**7-day expiry**: cloned voices that haven't been used in TTS within 7 days are automatically expired. Running TTS with a cloned voice automatically refreshes its expiry. Idle voices that lapse must be re-cloned ($1.50 again).

### Credentials vault

Persist logins created on external platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc.) so they can be reused on the next run. Passwords are AES-256-GCM encrypted with a server-side key and only decrypted on `get`.

```bash
# Create
wonda credentials create --website instagram.com --username myhandle \
  --email me@example.com --password-stdin <<< "hunter2" \
  --metadata '{"signup_source":"wonda-email"}'

# List (passwords omitted)
wonda credentials list --website instagram.com

# Get full record including decrypted password
wonda credentials get <id>

# Update any field (use --password-stdin to rotate; --username "" to clear)
wonda credentials update <id> --username newhandle

# Delete
wonda credentials delete <id>

# Fetch + record why you're using it in one call — POST, not GET, because
# it writes a 'used' event with the reason. Prefer this over `get` whenever
# you can articulate the reason.
wonda credentials use <id> --reason "instagram signup flow"

# See recent events (created / used / rotated / updated) for audit
wonda credentials events <id>
```

Fields: `website` (required — typed input like `insta` is canonicalized to `instagram.com`), `username`, `email`, `password` (required), `metadata` (arbitrary JSON). At least one of `username` / `email` must be present. Multiple records per `(website, username)` are allowed — dedupe on your side if you need to.

**Event log**: every `credentials get`/`use`, `create`, password rotate, and other updates are recorded as events on the credential (actor: `cli` | `web` | `system`). Use `credentials events <id>` or the web UI's history icon to audit. The event log is append-only and cascades on credential delete.

### Handing off to a human

If automation hits a screen that requires a human to take over (consent flow you shouldn't auto-accept, ambiguous UI, step where the user prefers to act themselves), use `wonda device stream <device-id>` — returns a `playerUrl` signed with a short-lived JWT (1h). Give that URL to the user, they act in their own browser, and automation can resume afterward.

```bash
wonda device stream <device-id>
# → { "streamUrl": "wss://…", "playerUrl": "https://…", "deviceType": "social" }
```

### Global output flags

All commands support these output control flags:

- `--json` — Force JSON output (auto-enabled when stdout is piped)
- `--quiet` — Only output the primary identifier (job ID, media ID, etc.) — ideal for scripting
- `-o <path>` — Download output to file (implies `--wait`)
- `--fields status,outputs` — Select specific JSON fields
- `--jq '.outputs[0].media.url'` — Filter JSON output with a jq expression

## How to think about content creation

You are a marketing director with access to a full production toolkit. Before touching any tool, think:

1. **What product category?** (beauty, food, tech, fashion, fitness, etc.)
2. **What format performs for this category?** (UGC memes for everyday products, cinematic for luxury, before/after for transformations, testimonial for services)
3. **What's the hook?** (relatable scenario, surprising twist, aspirational lifestyle, social proof)
4. **What specific scene?** (not "product on table" but "person discovering the product in a funny situation")

## Decision flow

When asked to create content, follow this order:

### Step 1: Gather context

```bash
wonda brand                                                    # Brand identity, colors, products, audience
wonda analytics instagram                                      # What content performs well
wonda scrape social --handle @competitor --platform instagram --wait  # Competitive research (if relevant)

# Cross-platform research (if relevant)
wonda x search "topic OR keyword"                              # Find conversations on X/Twitter
wonda x user-tweets @competitor                                # Competitor's recent tweets
wonda reddit search "topic" --sort top --time week             # Reddit discussions
wonda reddit feed marketing --sort hot                         # Subreddit trends
wonda linkedin search "topic" --type COMPANIES                 # LinkedIn company/people research
wonda linkedin profile competitor-vanity-name                  # LinkedIn profile intel
```

### Step 2: Check content skills

Content skills are step-by-step guides for common content types. Each skill tells you exactly which models, prompts, and editing operations to use — and in what order. ALWAYS check skills before building from scratch.

```bash
wonda skill list                                # Browse all content skills
wonda skill get <slug>                          # Full step-by-step guide for a skill
```

**Full skill index:**

| Slug                      | Description                                                                                                                           | Input                         |

| tiktok-ugc-pipeline       | Scrape viral reel → generate 5 UGC → post as drafts                                                                                   | reel or TikTok URL            |
| ugc-dance-motion          | Dance/motion transfer                                                                                                                 | image + video                 |
| marketing-brain           | Marketing strategy brain — hooks, visuals, ads                                                                                        | user brief                    |
| reddit-subreddit-intel    | Scrape top posts, analyze virality, generate ideas                                                                                    | subreddit + product           |
| twitter-influencer-search | Find X influencers and amplifiers                                                                                                     | competitor/niche keywords     |
| tiktok-slideshow-carousel | 3-slide TikTok carousel — hook, bridge, product reveal                                                                                | app screenshot + audience     |
| creative-static-ads       | Single-frame static ad images — 6 conversion pillars, 8 archetypes, 8 psychological hooks                                             | product + optional image      |
| ffmpeg                    | All local ffmpeg recipes — trim, audio swap, captions, social formats, scene split, silence cut, frame extraction, analysis artifacts | local video path or mediaId   |
| image-edit                | All image edit paths — img2img, background removal, crop, text overlay, vectorize                                                     | image mediaId or local path   |
| remotion-local-render     | Render editorPipeline blueprint steps locally via @remotion/renderer                                                                  | manifest JSON + editor job id |

**If a skill matches** → `wonda skill get <slug>`, read it, adapt to context, execute each step.

**If no skill matches** → build from scratch (Step 3).

### Step 2.5: Decide whether finishing should be local

Not every media task should go back through Wonda editing. Use this routing rule:

- Use `wonda` for AI generation, AI transcription/alignment, scraping, publishing, hosted transitions, and workflows that need media IDs or remote jobs.
- Use local `ffmpeg` for deterministic transforms on files you already have or can download: trim, crop/scale/pad, concat (merging multiple clips), replace audio, extract audio/frame, reverse, normalize for delivery, burn captions, split scenes, cut silence, and build analysis artifacts. **Always merge clips locally** — server-side merge can hang for 30+ minutes once any input exceeds ~7MB.

When a task starts from a Wonda media ID but the actual edit is deterministic, move it to local files first:

```bash
wonda media download <mediaId> -o ./input.mp4
```

Before any local ffmpeg work:

```bash
which ffmpeg
which ffprobe
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams -of json ./input.mp4
```

Font rule for local caption/text work:

- Prefer an explicit font file path over a family name.
- Never assume a font exists. Check first with `fc-match`, `fc-list`, `/System/Library/Fonts`, `/Library/Fonts`, `~/Library/Fonts`, or `/usr/share/fonts`.
- If the task is mainly local finishing/captions/formatting/splitting/artifact extraction, check the `ffmpeg` skill before inventing commands.
- `wonda edit video` renders locally by default for single-video ops (`trim`, `crop`, `speed`, `volume`, `textOverlay`, `animatedCaptions` with supplied captions, `editAudio`). The server returns a manifest; the CLI runs `@remotion/renderer` against a CloudFront-hosted bundle, uploads the output, and finalizes the editor_job. No flag needed. Pass `--render-server` only to force Lambda. Multi-video ops (`overlay`, `splitScreen`, `splitScenes`, `motionDesign`) auto-reject with a 400 — the CLI will tell you to use `--render-server`. **`merge` is also rejected locally, but do NOT fall back to `--render-server` — use the local `ffmpeg -f concat` recipe in the `ffmpeg` skill** (server merge can hang for 30+ minutes on inputs >~7MB). See the `remotion-local-render` content skill for the full Remotion recipe (including the STT-free TikTok-style caption flow via `wonda alignment extract-timestamps` → `--caption-segments`).

Default local export target unless the user asked otherwise:

```bash
-c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 192k
```

Always pass `-y` as the first flag so the command auto-overwrites the output. `ffmpeg` prompts interactively when the output path exists and agent shells hang on that prompt until timeout.

### Step 3: Build from scratch (chain endpoints)

When no skill matches, chain individual CLI commands. Each step produces an output that feeds into the next.

**Single asset:**

```bash
wonda generate image --model gpt-image-2 --prompt "..." --aspect-ratio 9:16 --wait -o out.png
# --params '{"quality":"high"}' — auto/low/medium/high (default auto)
# --negative-prompt "..."       — override what to exclude (model-dependent)
# --seed <number>               — pin the seed for reproducible results (model-dependent)
wonda generate video --model seedance-2 --prompt "..." --duration 5 --params '{"quality":"high"}' --wait -o out.mp4
wonda generate text --model <model> --prompt "..." --wait
wonda generate music --model suno-music --prompt "upbeat lo-fi" --wait -o music.mp3
```

**Audio (speech, transcription, dialogue):**

```bash
# List available voices (TTS + dialogue use the same set)
wonda audio voices

# Text-to-speech
wonda audio speech --model elevenlabs-tts --prompt "Your script here" \
  --params '{"voiceId":"hpp4J3VqNfWAUOO0d1Us"}' --wait -o speech.mp3
# elevenlabs-tts always requires a voiceId — pick one from `wonda audio voices`

# Transcribe audio/video to text
wonda audio transcribe --model elevenlabs-stt --attach $MEDIA --wait

# Multi-speaker dialogue (each speaker needs a voiceId from `wonda audio voices`)
wonda audio dialogue --model elevenlabs-dialogue \
  --prompt 'ALICE: Hi! BOB: Hello!' \
  --params '{"speakers":[{"label":"ALICE","voiceId":"hpp4J3VqNfWAUOO0d1Us"},{"label":"BOB","voiceId":"IKne3meq5aSn9XLyUdCD"}]}' \
  --wait -o dialogue.mp3
```

**Audio AI operations (direct-inference, NOT editor ops):**

```bash
# Denoise / dereverberate speech
wonda audio enhance --model replicate-resemble-enhance --attach $MEDIA \
  --params '{"denoise":true,"chunkSeconds":10}' --wait -o enhanced.wav

# Split a track into voice and instrumental stems
wonda audio extract-voice --model replicate-demucs --attach $MEDIA \
  --wait -o vocals.wav
```

DO NOT use `wonda edit video --operation enhanceAudio` or `--operation voiceExtractor` — those paths are deprecated. They still work but emit a warning, and they route through the heavier editor_job pipeline for no functional reason.

**Add animated captions to a video:**

The `animatedCaptions` operation handles everything in one step — it extracts audio, transcribes for word-level timing, and renders animated word-by-word captions onto the video.

```bash
# Generate a video with speech audio
VID_JOB=$(wonda generate video --model seedance-2 --prompt "..." --duration 5 --aspect-ratio 9:16 --params '{"quality":"high"}' --wait --quiet)
VID_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $VID_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')

# Add animated captions (single step)
wonda edit video --operation animatedCaptions --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"bottom-center","sizePercent":80,"strokeWidth":2.5,"fontSizeScale":0.8,"highlightColor":"rgb(252, 61, 61)"}' \
  --wait -o final.mp4
```

The video's original audio is preserved. Do NOT replace the audio with TTS — Sora already generated the speech.

**Alternative engine: `--captions-engine ffmpeg` (no Remotion).**

Use when the user wants the typewriter look, an opaque/rounded chyron behind text, or simply wants to skip the Remotion bundle + Chromium download. Plain `brew install ffmpeg` is enough. This path is CLI-only today (it does not go through `editor_job`, so credits are not charged for the local render).

```bash
# progressive (default for ffmpeg engine) — cumulative reveal,
# optional rounded pill behind the active word via highlightColor.
wonda edit video --operation animatedCaptions \
  --captions-engine ffmpeg --captions-preset progressive \
  --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --caption-segments "$(echo "$STT_OUT" | jq -c '.outputs[] | select(.outputKey=="wordTimestamps") | .outputValue | map({text: .word, startS: .start})')" \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans","textColor":"#FFFFFF","strokeColor":"#000000","strokeWidth":3,"fontSizeScale":1.1,"paddingBottom":25,"highlightColor":"#FF3D3D","backgroundBorderRadius":18}' \
  -o final.mp4

# typewriter — letters appear one at a time at constant interval (60ms/char)
# with a square white caret. Pass plain white text (no background).
wonda edit video --operation animatedCaptions \
  --captions-engine ffmpeg --captions-preset typewriter \
  --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --caption-segments "$STT_WORD_TIMESTAMPS" \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans","textColor":"#FFFFFF","fontSizeScale":1.1,"paddingBottom":12}' \
  -o final.mp4
```

Fonts are bundled into the binary, so the standard `fontFamily` values (TikTok Sans variants, Nohemi, Comic Cat, Gavency) work out of the box with no extra setup. `--fonts-dir` is an optional override for power users who want to bring their own font collection: when set, the renderer searches that directory first and only falls back to the bundled set if it doesn't find a match.

Vertical placement is controlled by `paddingBottom` (a percentage of canvas height, distance from canvas bottom to the caption's bottom edge). Sensible values: `12` for traditional bottom-of-frame subtitles, `25` for the TikTok 3/4-from-top sweet spot, `35` for visibly mid-bottom. `paddingTop` does the same when `position` starts with `top-*`. Without these, captions snap to the very edge of the canvas.

**Transitions (effects pipelines on a single video):**

```bash
wonda transitions presets                            # List built-in presets (JSON)
wonda transitions operations                         # Grouped by category (analysis/effect/...)
wonda transitions operations --json                  # Full per-param metadata
wonda transitions llms                               # Full reference (presets + ops + dependencies)
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset flash_glow --wait -o out.mp4
# Or send an agent-generated timeline of clips (inline JSON):
wonda transitions run --media $VID \
  --clips '[{"layer_type":"video","start_frame":0,"end_frame":60}]' --wait -o out.mp4
# Or from a file (handy for long agent timelines):
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips ./timeline.json --wait -o out.mp4
# To attach scene_transitions: pass an envelope (clips + scene_transitions)
# instead of a bare clip array — same file, both fields forwarded.
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips ./timeline_with_transitions.json --wait -o out.mp4
# where timeline_with_transitions.json is:
#   { "clips": [...],
#     "scene_transitions": [{"name":"crossfade","params":{"duration":8},"boundaries":[60]}] }
wonda transitions job <jobId>                        # Poll a transition job
```

Use exactly one of `--preset` or `--clips`. Requires a full (logged-in) account. **Always read `wonda transitions llms` first when composing a clips timeline.** It documents the detect/segment/effect dependencies, which ops need masks, and the full clip-spec shape (layer types, tracks, effects, transforms).

**Preset variables (`variables` block).** Each preset declares the template variables it accepts under `variables` in `wonda transitions presets`. Each entry has `name`, `description`, and `required`. Required variables MUST be supplied or the job is rejected with a 400 — no more silent skipping. Pass them with `--var name=value` (repeatable) or, for the common `prompt` case, the `--prompt` shortcut:

```bash
# flash_glow_prompted requires { prompt }
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset flash_glow_prompted \
  --prompt "woman in white dress" --wait -o out.mp4

# text_behind_person requires { prompt, text }
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset text_behind_person \
  --var prompt="the person" --var text="HELLO WORLD" --wait -o out.mp4

# Numeric-typed vars: bare digits are decoded as numbers, "true"/"false" as
# bools, everything else stays a string. Presets that compare frame indices
# numerically (border_frame, marquee_text, quick_motion_text, bg_remove_scale)
# need this — quoting an int turns it back into a string.
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset border_frame \
  --var exit_start_frame=200 --var exit_end_frame=251 --wait -o out.mp4
```

The `prompt` variable is a **detection text query** describing which subject to mask, fed to SAM3 to produce per-frame segmentation masks. Not a content-generation prompt.

Building a custom `--clips` timeline that needs detection masks? Add a clip with `layer_type: "video"` and a `mask: {layer_type: "mask", analysis_steps: [{name: segment, params: {prompt: "..."}}]}`. SAM3 handles both detection and segmentation in one step from the prompt, so no separate `detect` step is needed.

### Pre-warming masks before render (recommended)

For presets with `mask:<label>` variables, run `wonda transitions ensure-masks` first so the render starts with masks already prepared. The first call for a (media, label) pair takes 1-3 minutes; subsequent calls are near-instant.

```bash
# 1. Ensure masks are prepared for the labels you'll use, blocking until ready.
wonda transitions ensure-masks --media $VID --labels person,phone --wait

# 2. Run the render. Masks are already prepared.
wonda transitions run --media $VID --preset slide_reflect_background \
  --var "masks=mask:person+phone" --wait -o out.mp4
```

`ensure-masks` flags:

- `--media MEDIA_ID` — required, the video the masks are for
- `--label NAME` — repeatable, one label per call (`--label person --label phone`)
- `--labels NAME,NAME` — comma-separated alternative (`--labels person,phone`)
- `--wait` — block until every label is prepared
- `--timeout DUR` — cap wait time when `--wait` is set (default 10m)

Multi-prompt syntax: `mask:woman+phone` in `--var` is split into separate masks (`woman`, `phone`) and unioned per-frame. Pass each sub-label separately to `ensure-masks` so all of them are pre-warmed.

When to skip `ensure-masks`:

- Non-mask presets (no `mask:<label>` variables) — nothing to prepare
- A previous render already used these (media, labels) — already prepared

When `ensure-masks` matters most:

- First render of a new media with mask-based presets
- Iterating params on a render — pre-warm once, then run as many times as you want without re-preparing

**Multi-scene presets (`requiresMultiScene: true`).** Some presets use scene-aware logic and expect a video with multiple cuts/scenes. Check `requiresMultiScene` in `wonda transitions presets`. If true, feeding a single continuous shot will produce only one scene and the effect may look underwhelming. Combine clips first or use a video with natural cuts.

**Tweaking preset params.** Two cases depending on the preset's response shape from `wonda transitions presets --json`:

1. **Clip-shape preset** (response has `clips:` or `tracks:`): copy the JSON, edit any clip param, and submit as `--clips`. The request body shape matches the response shape.

   ```bash
   wonda transitions presets --json | jq '.presets[] | select(.name=="flash_glow_montage") | .clips' > /tmp/clips.json
   # edit /tmp/clips.json
   wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips "$(cat /tmp/clips.json)" --wait -o out.mp4
   ```

2. **Step-shape preset** (response has `steps:`): these are call-only. Submit by name with `--preset` and accept the published defaults; param tweaking awaits migration to clip-shape. Affected presets today: `bg_remove_scale`, `bullet_time`, `chromatic_aberration`, `psychedelic`, `vhs_fisheye`, `diagonal_wipe`, `nostalgic_summer`, `speed_ramp_transition`.

**Auto-repair safety net (`--auto-repair`, `--face-bbox`).** For `--clips` renders the worker runs a deterministic repair pass on the submitted JSON before rendering, default on. Repairs: width-fit font clamp, descender clamp against canvas bottom, stack-spacing snap (`ROW1_py` from cap-height formula), keyframe-bound clamp to `[0, source_duration]`, same-y-row caption overlap trim, mask full-duration extension, stroke-width zeroing, letter-spacing target snap per font, mask-cutout duration extension, negative-start clamp, and (with `--face-bbox`) face-overlap caption shift. Pass `--auto-repair=false` for strict validation; out-of-spec values then surface as render errors.

```bash
# Push body captions off the speaker's face. bbox is x1,y1,x2,y2 in canvas pixels (top-left origin).
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips ./timeline.json \
  --face-bbox 200,160,520,520 --wait -o out.mp4

# Strict mode — disable auto-repair to see exactly which clips fail validation.
wonda transitions run --media $VID --clips ./timeline.json \
  --auto-repair=false --wait -o out.mp4
```

`--face-bbox` only shifts body captions. Decorative text you want behind the speaker still routes through an explicit `mask_cutout {prompt: "person"}` clip.

**Output URL paths differ by job type:**

- Inference jobs (generate, audio): `.outputs[0].media.url` and `.outputs[0].media.mediaId`
- Editor jobs (edit): `.outputs[0].url` and `.outputs[0].mediaId`

## Model waterfall

### Image

Default: `gpt-image-2`. OpenAI's flagship — strongest prompt adherence, best text-in-image, high-fidelity edits via reference images. Handles 1-4 reference images. Quality tiers: `auto` (default), `low`, `medium`, `high` — pass via `--params '{"quality":"high"}'`. Caps at 1536px output.

For img2img editing specifically (change, add/remove, restyle, bg-remove, crop, text overlay, vectorize), use `wonda skill get image-edit` — it has the full edit-specific decision tree.

Pick something else only when one of these applies:

- User explicitly requests another model
- **More than 4 reference images** → `nano-banana-2` (gpt-image-2 caps at 4 refs; nano-banana-2 accepts up to 14). For 1-4 refs, stay on `gpt-image-2`.
- Need vector output → `runware-vectorize`
- Need background removal → `birefnet-bg-removal`
- Cheapest possible / fastest drafts → `z-image`
- Need >1536px / true 4K output → `nano-banana-pro` (1K/2K/4K) or `nano-banana-2` (1K/2K/4K). gpt-image-2 caps at 1536px.
- gpt-image-2 unavailable / OpenAI down → `nano-banana-2` or `seedream-4-5` or `grok-imagine-pro`

### Video

Default: `seedance-2` (duration 5/10/15s, default 5s, quality: high). Escalation:

- Quality complaint or different style → `sora2` or `sora2pro`
- Max single-clip duration is **15s** for Seedance 2, **20s** for Sora → for longer content, stitch multiple clips via merge
- Veo (`veo3_1`, `veo3_1-fast`) is available but NOT in the default waterfall. Only pick Veo when the user explicitly asks for Veo by name.

**Image-to-video routing (MANDATORY when attaching a reference image):**

- Person/face visible in the **reference image** → MUST use `kling_3_pro` (preserves identity better for faces)
- No person in reference image → use `seedance-2`
- **Text-to-video (no reference image):** Seedance 2 generates people fine. This rule ONLY applies when you `--attach` an image.

**Kling model family:**

- `kling_3_pro` — Text-to-video and image-to-video, supports start/end images, custom elements (@Element1, @Element2), 3-15s duration, 16:9/9:16/1:1
- `kling_2_6_pro` — General purpose, 5-10s, 16:9/9:16/1:1, text-to-video and image-to-video
- `kling_2_6_motion_control` — Motion transfer: requires both a reference image AND a reference video, recreates the video's motion with the image's appearance
- `kling2_5-pro` — Budget Kling option, 5-10s, supports first/last frame images

**Kling prompt rules (important):** Kling's prompt field caps at **2,500 characters** and Kling responds poorly to Sora-style structured briefs (`SCENE:` / `SUBJECT:` / `MOTION:` / `BANNED LOOK:` section headers). In that format Kling latches onto atmosphere nouns and silently drops the central subject (verified empirically: the same 2,842-char Sora-style prompt that rendered correctly on Sora 2 Pro and Seedance 2 produced no phone at all on Kling — even when trimmed to 2,250 chars). When escalating Seedance → Kling, or targeting Kling directly, **rewrite the prompt as short natural-language prose (~1,000–1,500 chars)** and **lead with the hero subject in the opening sentence** rather than burying it inside a `SUBJECT:` block. Do NOT pass a Sora-formatted prompt through to Kling unchanged.

**Other video models:**

- `grok-imagine-video` — xAI video generation, 5-15s, supports 7 aspect ratios including 4:3 and 3:2
- `topaz-video-upscale` — Upscale video resolution (1-4x factor, supports fps conversion)
- `sync-lipsync-v2-pro` — Legacy lipsync for user-supplied video + audio pairs. Inferior to native-audio generation and almost never the right choice for new content. See the "Lip sync" section for rules.

Seedance family (DEFAULT video model, watermarks automatically removed):

- `seedance-2` — Base Seedance 2.0 (T2V/I2V, 5-15s, high=standard/basic=fast)
- `seedance-2-omni` — Multi-reference generation (images, audio refs)
- `seedance-2-video-edit` — Edit existing video via text prompt

**Video durations:** Accepted `--duration` values vary by model. Check with `wonda capabilities` or `wonda models info <slug>`.

### Audio

- Music: `suno-music` (set `--params '{"instrumental":true}'` for no vocals)
- Text-to-speech: `elevenlabs-tts` — only for explicit narrator/voice-over asks over silent footage. Do NOT use to "make a UGC character talk" — Sora / Sora 2 Pro / Veo 3.1 / Kling 3 / Seedance 2 generate native synced speech in any language, which looks and sounds far better. Always set voiceId in params. Default female voice: `--params '{"voiceId":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"}'` (Rachel).
- Transcription: `elevenlabs-stt`
- Multi-speaker dialogue: `elevenlabs-dialogue`
- Enhance audio (clean up noisy speech): `replicate-resemble-enhance` via `wonda audio enhance` — denoise + dereverberate. Use when a voice recording sounds muffled, echoey, or has background noise. NOT a general "sounds better" button; if the source is already clean this can soften it.
- Extract voice (isolate vocals / split stems): `replicate-demucs` via `wonda audio extract-voice` — splits into voice and instrumental tracks. Use to pull a speaker or singer off a track, or to isolate the music behind a vocal.

**Native synced speech (preferred over TTS + lipsync):** Sora, Sora 2 Pro, Veo 3.1, Kling 3, and Seedance 2 all generate dialogue in any language directly inside the video, with mouth movements baked in. Put the line (and language) in the video model's `--prompt`. Never chain `elevenlabs-tts` → `sync-lipsync-v2-pro` to fake speech over a silent generation.

## Characters

Characters are reusable saved combos (image + optional voice audio) you can mention in Kling prompts with `@name`. The server auto-injects the image as `start_image` and the audio (with its Kling `voice_id`) as `voice_audio` whenever a Kling model is selected. Name rules: must start with a letter, 1–31 chars, alphanumeric + `_`/`-`.

**From a Kling clip** — extract a frame + voice from a generation you like:

```bash
VID=$(wonda generate video --model kling_3_pro --prompt "young man, grey tshirt, talking to camera" --wait --quiet)
VID_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $VID --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
wonda character from-media alex --source $VID_MEDIA --frame-ms 2500
wonda generate video --model kling_3_pro --prompt "@alex welcomes viewers to the channel" --wait -o alex-welcome.mp4
```

**From scratch** — generate a portrait and a TTS sample, then bind them:

```bash
IMG=$(wonda generate image --model nano-banana-2 --prompt "young woman, studio portrait" --wait --quiet)
IMG_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $IMG --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
AUD=$(wonda audio speech --model elevenlabs-tts --prompt "Hi, this is me" --params '{"voiceId":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"}' --wait --quiet)
AUD_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $AUD --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
wonda character create maya --image $IMG_MEDIA --audio $AUD_MEDIA
```

List / inspect / update / delete: `wonda character list`, `wonda character get <name>`, `wonda character update <name> --audio $NEW`, `wonda character delete <name>`. Only one character with audio can be referenced per Kling generation.

## Prompt writing rules

Follow this waterfall top-to-bottom. Use the FIRST matching rule and stop.

1. **PASSTHROUGH** — If the user says "use my exact prompt" / "verbatim" / "no enhancements" → copy their words exactly. Zero modifications.

2. **IMAGE-TO-VIDEO** — When a source image feeds into a video model, describe MOTION ONLY. The model can see the image. Do NOT describe the image content.
   - Good: `"gentle breathing motion, camera slowly pushes in, atmospheric lighting shifts"`
   - Bad: `"Two cats on a lavender background breathing softly"` (describes the image)

3. **EMPTY PROMPT (from scratch)** — Use the user's exact request as the prompt. Do NOT add style descriptors, lighting, composition, or mood.
   - User says "create an image of a cat with sunglasses" → prompt: `"create an image of a cat with sunglasses"`
   - Do NOT enhance to `"A playful orange tabby wearing oversized reflective sunglasses, studio lighting, shallow depth of field"`

4. **NON-EMPTY PROMPT (adapting a template)** — Keep the structure and style, only swap content to match the user's request. Keep prompts literal and constraint-heavy.

## Aspect ratio rules

Three cases, no exceptions:

1. User specifies a ratio → use it: `--aspect-ratio 16:9`
2. User doesn't mention ratio → explicitly set `--aspect-ratio 9:16` for social content (UGC, TikTok, Reels, Stories). Portrait is the default for any social/marketing video.
3. Editing existing media → use `--aspect-ratio auto` to preserve source dimensions

**UGC and social content is ALWAYS portrait (9:16).** If someone asks for a TikTok, Reel, Story, or UGC video, always use `--aspect-ratio 9:16`. Landscape is only for YouTube, presentations, or when explicitly requested.

**Square (1:1)** is supported by all Kling models and some image models — use for Instagram feed posts when requested.

## Common chaining patterns

These patterns show how to compose multi-step pipelines by chaining CLI commands. Each step's output feeds into the next.

> **No need to download and re-upload between steps.** Every generation and edit
> produces a media ID in its output. Pass that ID directly to the next command
> via `--media` or `--audio-media`. Use `--jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId'`
> for inference jobs and `--jq '.outputs[0].mediaId'` for editor jobs.
> Only use `-o <file>` on the FINAL step to download the finished output.

### Animate an image to video

```bash
MEDIA=$(wonda media upload ./product.jpg --quiet)
# No person in image → Seedance 2
wonda generate video --model seedance-2 --prompt "camera slowly pushes in, product rotates" \
  --attach $MEDIA --duration 5 --params '{"quality":"high"}' --wait -o animated.mp4
# Person in image → Kling (ONLY when attaching a reference image with a person)
wonda generate video --model kling_3_pro --prompt "the person turns and smiles" \
  --attach $MEDIA --duration 5 --wait -o person.mp4
```

### Replace audio on a video (TTS voiceover or music)

```bash
# Generate TTS
TTS_JOB=$(wonda audio speech --model elevenlabs-tts --prompt "The script" \
  --params '{"voiceId":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"}' --wait --quiet)
TTS_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $TTS_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
# Mix onto video (mute original, full voiceover)
wonda edit video --operation editAudio --media $VID_MEDIA --audio-media $TTS_MEDIA \
  --params '{"videoVolume":0,"audioVolume":100}' --wait -o with-voice.mp4
```

Only use this when you need to REPLACE the video's audio. Sora, Sora 2 Pro, Veo 3.1, Kling 3, and Seedance 2 all generate native synced speech in any language — don't replace it with TTS unless the user explicitly asks for a different voiceover. Never reach for this step to "add speech" to a UGC/talking-head clip; put the dialogue in the video model's prompt instead.

### Add static text overlay

Static overlays (meme text, "chat did i cook", etc.) use smaller font sizes than captions. They're ambient, not meant to dominate the frame.

```bash
wonda edit video --operation textOverlay --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --prompt-text "chat, did i cook" \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"top-center","sizePercent":66,"fontSizeScale":0.5,"strokeWidth":4.5,"paddingTop":10}' \
  --wait -o with-text.mp4
```

**Featured textOverlay + animatedCaptions presets.** `wonda edit {video,image,audio}` accepts `--preset <name>` (scoped to `--operation`). `--params` fields override preset values on key collisions.

`textOverlay` (static, top-centered):

- `TikTok White Highlight` — black text on a slightly rounded white box.
- `TikTok Black Highlight` — white text on a slightly rounded black box.
- `TikTok Red Highlight` — white text on a slightly rounded red (`#E14135`) box.

`animatedCaptions` (STT-driven, bottom-centered):

- `TikTok White Captions` — black text, white highlight on the active word.
- `TikTok Black Captions` — white text, black highlight on the active word.
- `TikTok Red Captions` — white text, red (`#E14135`) highlight on the active word.

```bash
wonda edit video --operation textOverlay \
  --preset "TikTok Red Highlight" --media <id> \
  --params '{"text":"YOUR HEADLINE"}' --wait -o ./out.mp4
```

Image `textOverlay` requires `--render-server`; video renders locally by default.

**Font sizing guide:**

- Static overlays: `sizePercent: 66`, `fontSizeScale: 0.5`, `strokeWidth: 4.5`
- Animated captions: `sizePercent: 80`, `fontSizeScale: 0.8`, `strokeWidth: 2.5`, `highlightColor: rgb(252, 61, 61)`
- Font: `TikTok Sans SemiCondensed` for both

### Add animated captions (word-by-word with timing)

The `animatedCaptions` operation extracts audio, transcribes, and renders animated word-by-word captions — all in one step.

```bash
wonda edit video --operation animatedCaptions --media $VIDEO_MEDIA \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"bottom-center","sizePercent":80,"strokeWidth":2.5,"fontSizeScale":0.8,"highlightColor":"rgb(252, 61, 61)"}' \
  --wait -o with-captions.mp4
```

For quick static captions (no timing, just text on screen), use `textOverlay` with `--prompt-text`:

```bash
wonda edit video --operation textOverlay --media $VIDEO_MEDIA \
  --prompt-text "Summer Sale - 50% Off" \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"bottom-center","sizePercent":80}' \
  --wait -o captioned.mp4
```

### Add background music

```bash
MUSIC_JOB=$(wonda generate music --model suno-music \
  --prompt "upbeat lo-fi hip hop, warm vinyl crackle" --wait --quiet)
MUSIC_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get inference $MUSIC_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].media.mediaId')
wonda edit video --operation editAudio --media $VID_MEDIA --audio-media $MUSIC_MEDIA \
  --params '{"videoVolume":100,"audioVolume":30}' --wait -o with-music.mp4
```

### Editor output chaining

When chaining multiple editor operations (e.g., editAudio → animatedCaptions → textOverlay), extract the media ID from each editor job output and pass it to the next step. Note the jq path differs from inference jobs:

```bash
# Inference jobs: .outputs[0].media.mediaId
# Editor jobs:    .outputs[0].mediaId

EDIT_JOB=$(wonda edit video --operation editAudio --media $VID --audio-media $AUDIO \
  --params '{"videoVolume":0,"audioVolume":100}' --wait --quiet)
STEP1_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get editor $EDIT_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].mediaId')

CAP_JOB=$(wonda edit video --operation animatedCaptions --media $STEP1_MEDIA \
  --params '{"fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","position":"bottom-center","sizePercent":80,"strokeWidth":2.5,"fontSizeScale":0.8,"highlightColor":"rgb(252, 61, 61)"}' --wait --quiet)
STEP2_MEDIA=$(wonda jobs get editor $CAP_JOB --jq '.outputs[0].mediaId')

wonda edit video --operation textOverlay --media $STEP2_MEDIA \
  --prompt-text "Hook text" --params '{"position":"top-center","fontFamily":"TikTok Sans SemiCondensed","sizePercent":66,"fontSizeScale":0.5,"strokeWidth":4.5}' --wait -o final.mp4
```

### Merge multiple clips

**Always merge locally with ffmpeg.** Server-side merge (`wonda edit video --operation merge`) can hang for 30+ minutes once any input exceeds ~7MB.

Download every Wonda media ID, then concat. Stream-copy is fast but requires matching codec/profile/resolution; fall back to re-encode if it errors:

```bash
wonda media download $CLIP1 -o /tmp/clip-1.mp4
wonda media download $CLIP2 -o /tmp/clip-2.mp4
wonda media download $CLIP3 -o /tmp/clip-3.mp4
cat > /tmp/concat.txt <<EOF
file '/tmp/clip-1.mp4'
file '/tmp/clip-2.mp4'
file '/tmp/clip-3.mp4'
EOF
ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i /tmp/concat.txt -c copy /tmp/merged.mp4
# If stream-copy fails, re-encode:
# ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i /tmp/concat.txt \
#   -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart \
#   -c:a aac -b:a 192k /tmp/merged.mp4

# Re-upload only if a downstream wonda step needs the mediaId.
MERGED_MEDIA=$(wonda media upload /tmp/merged.mp4 --quiet)
```

File order in `concat.txt` = playback order. See the `ffmpeg` skill for the full concat reference.

### Split scenes / keep a specific scene

Two modes — pick by intent:

```bash
# Keep a specific scene (split mode) — splits into scenes, auto-selects one
wonda edit video --operation splitScenes --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --params '{"mode":"split","threshold":0.5,"minClipDuration":2,"outputSelection":"last"}' \
  --wait -o last-scene.mp4
# outputSelection: "first", "last", or 1-indexed number (e.g. 2 for second scene)

# Remove a scene (omit mode) — removes one scene, merges the rest
wonda edit video --operation splitScenes --media $VID_MEDIA \
  --params '{"mode":"omit","threshold":0.5,"minClipDuration":2,"outputSelection":"first"}' \
  --wait -o without-first.mp4
# outputSelection: which scene to REMOVE
```

Use omit mode for "remove frozen first frame" (common with Sora videos). Use split mode for "keep just scene X".

### Image editing

Any image edit — img2img, background removal, crop, text overlay, vectorize — has its own skill with the full decision tree, aspect-ratio rules, and model waterfall for edits:

```bash
wonda skill get image-edit
```

One gotcha worth keeping here: image and video background removal use **different** models (`birefnet-bg-removal` vs `bria-video-background-removal`). Never swap them.

### Lip sync (last-resort fallback — prefer native-audio video models)

Sora, Sora 2 Pro, Veo 3.1, Kling 3, and Seedance 2 all generate speech in any language with correctly synced mouth movements as part of the video itself. That path produces dramatically better results than `sync-lipsync-v2-pro`: better lip physics, better lighting, better costs, and no second inference round-trip. For any talking UGC, ad, or spokesperson video, put the dialogue directly in the video model's prompt — do not chain TTS + lipsync.

Only reach for `sync-lipsync-v2-pro` when the user EXPLICITLY supplies both a pre-existing video and a pre-existing audio clip and asks you to align the mouth to that audio. If a user asks for lipsync as the default method of making a character speak, push back: the native-audio video models are the better tool and work in any language.

```bash
wonda generate video --model sync-lipsync-v2-pro --attach $VIDEO_MEDIA,$AUDIO_MEDIA --wait -o synced.mp4
```

### Video upscale

```bash
wonda generate video --model topaz-video-upscale --attach $VIDEO_MEDIA \
  --params '{"upscaleFactor":2}' --wait -o upscaled.mp4
```

### Clipping (longform → vertical shorts)

`wonda clipping` takes a long video (podcast, interview, talking-head)
and produces short vertical clips. Selection is LLM-driven and supports
a natural-language `--brief` so you can ask for specific moments instead
of generic virality.

V1 renders 9:16 with **face-tracked reframe** (LR-ASD active-speaker
detection + One-Euro stabilizer, default) and the existing
`animatedCaptions` op + a top-third hook overlay per clip. Pass
`--reframe blur-fill` to keep the full landscape source inside a
vertical canvas with a blurred background instead.

Async: `POST /api/v1/clipping` returns a `clippingJobId`; the CLI polls
`GET /api/v1/clipping/jobs/{id}` under `--wait`. Pass `--output <dir>`
and the CLI downloads each rendered clip + a `plan.json`.

Auth: requires the `clippingEnabled` PostHog feature flag in prod; local
dev bypasses automatically.

**Source — never pass YouTube URLs to `--url`.** The flag exists on the
CLI but the underlying `--url` flow shells out to `yt-dlp` on the
**video-worker container** (Cloud Run / GCP datacenter IP). YouTube
blocks datacenter IPs with the "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"
challenge and the worker has no cookie store, so YouTube ingest fails
at progress 0.05 with that error and the LLM hold has to be released.
For YouTube, always download locally and upload first:

```bash
yt-dlp -o /tmp/source.mp4 \
  -f "bv*[ext=mp4][height<=720]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4][height<=720]" \
  --merge-output-format mp4 "<youtube-url>"
MEDIA=$(wonda media upload /tmp/source.mp4 --quiet)
```

`--url` is fine for **direct mp4 URLs** (no JS, no anti-bot cookies).

```bash
# Plan only — fast, no render
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --brief "the most controversial moments" --dry-run --wait

# Full pipeline: select + render + download
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA \
  --brief "the most controversial moments" \
  --caption-preset "TikTok Red Captions" \
  --hook auto \
  --wait --output ./clips/

# Filter by speaker (uses ElevenLabs diarization labels)
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --speaker SPEAKER_00 --wait --output ./clips/

# Speaker rename for readable rationales
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --speaker Joe \
  --speaker-map '{"SPEAKER_00":"Joe","SPEAKER_01":"Guest"}' --wait --output ./clips/

# Tune count and durations — pick a target length with a tolerance
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --brief "punchy one-liners" \
  --count 5 --duration 20 --tolerance 5 --wait --output ./clips/

# Or specify an explicit min/max range instead (mutually exclusive
# with --duration/--tolerance)
wonda clipping --media $MEDIA --brief "punchy one-liners" \
  --count 5 --min-duration 8 --max-duration 30 --wait --output ./clips/

wonda x reply <tweet-id-or-url> "Great point"        # Reply
wonda x like <tweet-id-or-url>                       # Like

# Maintenance
wonda x refresh-ids                                  # Refresh cached GraphQL query IDs from X's JS bundles
```

All paginated commands support: `-n <count>`, `--cursor`, `--all`, `--max-pages`, `--delay <ms>`.

**Tweet modes:** The `tweet` command has two modes:

- **Default (API):** X's internal GraphQL (`CreateTweet` for ≤280 chars, `CreateNoteTweet` for long-form Premium). Fast (<1s), supports `--attach` for media. Occasionally fails with error 226 when X rotates query IDs or feature flags — when that happens, recapture via `twitter-tone-research/_artifacts/scripts/capture-ct-bw.mjs` and bump the three knobs in `xclient/`.
- **`--browser` (Patchright):** Launches a real undetected Chrome browser, opens x.com compose, types with human-style jitter, clicks Post. Supports `--attach` (image/gif/video, up to 4) — files are driven through the hidden compose input via Playwright's `setInputFiles`, no native picker dialog opens; the script waits for X's upload pipeline to finalize (up to 5 min for video) before submitting. Zero fingerprinting risk. Slower (~10s text, ~30-90s with video) but fully drift-proof — no queryIds, feature flags, or request shape to maintain. Requires: `npm i patchright && npx patchright install chromium`.

### LinkedIn

Supports search, profiles, companies, messaging, and engagement.

```bash
# Auth setup (run `wonda linkedin auth --help` for details)
wonda linkedin auth set --li-at-value <v> --jsessionid-value <v>
wonda linkedin auth set --account brand-A --li-at-value <...> --jsessionid-value <...>  # multi-account
wonda linkedin auth check

# Read
wonda linkedin me                                    # Your identity
wonda linkedin search "data engineer" --type PEOPLE  # Search (types: PEOPLE, COMPANIES, ALL)
wonda linkedin profile johndoe                       # View profile (vanity name or URL)
wonda linkedin company google                        # View company page
wonda linkedin conversations                         # List message threads
wonda linkedin messages <conversation-urn>           # Read messages in a thread
wonda linkedin notifications -n 20                   # Recent notifications
wonda linkedin connections                           # Your connections
wonda linkedin reactions <activity-id>               # Reactions with reactor profiles + type
wonda linkedin browser-bootstrap                     # Inject stored cookies into patchright profile (one-time + on rotation)
wonda linkedin comments <activity-id> --browser      # Commenters with profile + vanity (needs patchright-li-driver running; see its README)

# Write
wonda linkedin connect <vanity-name> --message "Hey!" # Send connection request with note
wonda linkedin connect <vanity-name> -m "Hey!" --browser  # Full stealth via real browser (Patchright)
wonda linkedin like <activity-urn>                   # Like a post
wonda linkedin unlike <activity-urn>                 # Remove a like
wonda linkedin send-message <conversation-urn> "Hi!" # Send a message
wonda linkedin post "Excited to announce..."         # Create a post
wonda linkedin delete-post <activity-id>             # Delete a post
```

Paginated commands support: `-n <count>`, `--start`, `--all`, `--max-pages`, `--delay <ms>`.

**Connection request modes:** The `connect` command has two modes:

- **Default (API):** Voyager REST API with fingerprint mitigations (profile visit → drawer warm-up → connect). Fast (~3s), supports notes via `customMessage`.
- **`--browser` (Patchright):** Launches a real undetected Chrome browser, navigates to the profile, and clicks through the UI. Zero fingerprinting risk. Slower (~10s) but fully safe. Use this as a fallback if you want full protection. Requires: `npm i patchright && npx patchright install chromium`.

### Reddit

Auth is optional — many reads work unauthenticated. Supports search, feeds, users, posts, trending, and chat/DMs.

```bash
# Auth setup (run `wonda reddit auth --help` for details)
wonda reddit auth set --session-value <jwt>
wonda reddit auth set --account burner-1 --session-value <jwt>  # multi-account
wonda reddit auth check

# Read (works without auth)
wonda reddit search "AI video" --sort top --time week   # Search posts (sort: relevance, hot, top, new, comments)
wonda reddit subreddit marketing                        # Subreddit info
wonda reddit feed marketing --sort hot                  # Subreddit posts (sort: hot, new, top, rising)
wonda reddit user spez                                  # User profile
wonda reddit user-posts spez --sort top                 # User's posts
wonda reddit user-comments spez                         # User's comments
wonda reddit post <id-or-url> -n 50                     # Post with comments
wonda reddit trending --sort hot                        # Popular/trending posts

# Read (requires auth)
wonda reddit home --sort best                           # Your home feed

# Write (requires auth)
wonda reddit submit marketing --title "Great tool" --text "Check this out..."  # Self post
wonda reddit submit marketing --title "Great tool" --url "https://..."         # Link post
wonda reddit comment <parent-fullname> --text "Nice post!"                     # Reply
wonda reddit vote <fullname> --up                       # Upvote (--down, --unvote)
wonda reddit subscribe marketing                        # Subscribe (--unsub to unsubscribe)
wonda reddit save <fullname>                            # Save a post or comment
wonda reddit unsave <fullname>                          # Unsave
wonda reddit delete <fullname>                          # Delete your post or comment
```

Paginated commands support: `-n <count>`, `--after <cursor>`, `--all`, `--max-pages`, `--delay <ms>`.

### Reddit chat / DMs

Direct messaging via the Matrix protocol. Requires a separate chat token.

```bash
# Auth setup (run `wonda reddit chat auth-set --help` for details)
wonda reddit chat auth-set

# Read
wonda reddit chat inbox                                  # List DM conversations with latest messages
wonda reddit chat messages <room-id> -n 50               # Fetch messages from a room
wonda reddit chat all-rooms                              # List ALL joined rooms (not limited to sync window)

# Write
wonda reddit chat send <room-id> --text "Hey!"           # Send a DM (mimics browser typing behavior)

# Management
wonda reddit chat accept-all                             # Accept all pending chat requests
wonda reddit chat refresh                                # Force-refresh the Matrix chat token
```

**Important**: The chat token expires every ~24h. The CLI auto-refreshes on use, but if it expires fully, re-run `auth-set`. Rate limit DM sends to 15-20/day with varied text to avoid detection. The `send` command includes a typing delay (1-5s) to mimic human behavior.

## Workflow & discovery

### Video analysis

Analyze a video to extract a composite frame grid (visual) and audio transcript (text). Useful for understanding video content before creating variations. Requires a **full account** (not anonymous) and costs credits based on video duration (ElevenLabs STT pricing).

If the video was just uploaded and is still normalizing, the CLI auto-retries until the media is ready.

```bash
# Analyze a video — returns composite grid image + transcript
ANALYSIS_JOB=$(wonda analyze video --media $VIDEO_MEDIA --wait --quiet)

# The job output contains:
# - compositeGrid: image showing 24 evenly-spaced frames
# - transcript: full text of any speech
# - wordTimestamps: word-level timing [{word, start, end}]
# - videoMetadata: {width, height, durationMs, fps, aspectRatio}

# Download the composite grid for visual inspection
wonda analyze video --media $VIDEO_MEDIA --wait -o /tmp/grid.jpg

# Get just the transcript
wonda analyze video --media $VIDEO_MEDIA --wait --jq '.outputs[] | select(.outputKey=="transcript") | .outputValue'
```

**Error handling**: 402 = insufficient credits, 409 = media still processing (CLI auto-retries).

### Chat (AI assistant)

Interactive chat sessions for content creation — the AI handles generation, editing, and iteration.

```bash
wonda chat create --title "Product launch"            # New session
wonda chat list                                       # List sessions (--limit, --offset)
wonda chat messages <chatId>                          # Get messages
wonda chat send <chatId> --message "Create a UGC reaction video"
wonda chat send <chatId> --message "Edit it" --media <id>
wonda chat send <chatId> --message "..." --aspect-ratio 9:16 --quality-tier max
wonda chat send <chatId> --message "..." --style <styleId>
wonda chat send <chatId> --message "..." --passthrough-prompt  # Use exact prompt, no AI enhancement
```

### Jobs & runs

```bash
wonda jobs get inference <id>                         # Inference job status
wonda jobs get editor <id>                            # Editor job status
wonda jobs get publish <id>                           # Publish job status
wonda jobs wait inference <id> --timeout 20m          # Wait for completion
wonda run get <runId>                                 # Run status
wonda run wait <runId> --timeout 30m                  # Wait for run completion
```

### Discovery

```bash
wonda models list                                     # All available models
wonda models info <slug>                              # Model details and params
wonda operations list                                 # All editor operations
wonda operations info <operation>                     # Operation details
wonda capabilities                                    # Full platform capabilities
wonda pricing list                                    # Pricing for all models
wonda pricing estimate --model seedance-2 --prompt "..." # Cost estimate
wonda style list                                      # Available visual styles
wonda topup                                            # Top up credits (opens Stripe checkout)
```

### Editing audio & images

```bash
# Edit audio
wonda edit audio --operation <op> --media <id> --wait -o out.mp3
```

For any image edit (crop, text overlay, img2img, background removal, vectorize) pull the dedicated skill: `wonda skill get image-edit`.

### Alignment (timestamp extraction)

```bash
wonda alignment extract-timestamps --model <model> --attach <mediaId> --wait
```

## Quality tiers

| Tier     | Image Model                                    | Resolution                              | Video Model              | When                                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard | `gpt-image-2` (auto) — alt: `nano-banana-2` 1K | 1024×1024 / 1024×1536 (gpt) / 1K (nano) | `seedance-2` (high, 5s)  | Default. gpt-image-2 for strongest prompt adherence + text-in-image; nano-banana-2 for faster Gemini iteration with multi-reference support.       |
| High     | `gpt-image-2` (high) — alt: `nano-banana-2` 2K | 1024×1024 / 1024×1536 (gpt) / 2K (nano) | `seedance-2` (high, 15s) | Crisp output. Use `--params '{"quality":"high"}'` on gpt-image-2 or bump `--params '{"resolution":"2K"}'` on nano-banana-2. Also offer `sora2pro`. |
| Max      | `nano-banana-pro` 4K — alt: `nano-banana-2` 4K | 4K                                      | `seedance-2` (high, 15s) | True 4K (gpt-image-2 caps at 1536px). Use `--params '{"resolution":"4K"}'`. Also offer `sora2pro` (1080p) for video.                               |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                          | Likely Cause                                  | Fix                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sora rejected image              | Person in image                               | Switch to `kling_3_pro`                                |
| Video adds objects not in source | Motion prompt describes elements not in image | Simplify to camera movement and atmosphere only        |
| Text unreadable in video         | AI tried to render text in generation         | Remove text from video prompt, use textOverlay instead |
| Hands look wrong                 | Complex hand actions in prompt                | Simplify to passive positions or frame to exclude      |
| Style inconsistent across series | No shared anchor                              | Use same reference image via `--attach`                |
| Changes to step A not in step B  | Stale render                                  | Re-run all downstream steps                            |
